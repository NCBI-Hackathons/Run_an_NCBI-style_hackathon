# Background

Hackathons, in which participants work in groups to solve defined problems over the course of a few days, have been successfully used to address a variety of scientific problems. The following is a

# Example pipelines
Numerous examples of projects developed at NCBI hackathons can be found here: https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/ 
An F1000 collection of articles that came out of these hackathons can be found here: https://f1000research.com/collections/hackathons 

# Potenial uses
* Education: teaching scientists how to code using a hands-on, pragmatic, active-learning approach
* Rapid prototyping of new tools
* Method for creating group cohesion and building leadership skills

# Potential disciplinary areas
This happens to be a bioinformatics/computational biology hackathon, but could this be done in other contexts, especially:
* Biomedical sciences
* Environmental sciences
* Social sciences, psychology, etc.
* Digital humanities
* Data Journalism
