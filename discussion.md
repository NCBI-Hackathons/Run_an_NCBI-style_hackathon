# Notes on discussion with project team members

## Team 1, Barcoding project
*Brian, Tuesday morning*

**What has surprised you?**

>The high quality of skilled team mates. Everybody came from different backgrounds, but they got working together well really quick.


**What unanticipated challenges or problems have come up?**

> Nothing beyond the technical stuff (ie, having to learn some things on the fly).

> The team's project was given to the team by someone who is not on the team or in the hackathon, so that has been challenging in the sense of most of the team members were not coming directly from the problem space of the project.


**What have you learned so far?  (Such as any new tools, approaches, etc?)**
> Had to learn the python module `argparse` for creating a command line tool.

>Had to learn about the backend sequencing (how data is created, errors, etc), which is not part of my day to day work.


**How have your plans/goals/approaches changed?  (The approach you are taking to reach your goals?)**
> Not much, has been pretty straight going. The team leader sees that this project can benefit my work, so my guidance has been good.


**What do you wish you would have known or done when you started out with this project?**
>Nothing much, I came in with an open mind and have found this hackathon experience to be good.


**What tips would you give other hackathon participants?**
>Come in with an open mind, and be prepared to be flexible.
