# Collaborative Computational Development: Running an NCBI-Style Hackathon
This document provides guidance on how to run an [NCBI-style hackathon](https://f1000research.com/articles/5-672/v2). We invite members of the community to make edits and additions by submitting pull requests. The original document was developed by a team during the June 2017 hackathon held at the New York Genome Center:

* Team lead: Lisa Federer
* Dmitry Brogun
* Peter Oxley
* Franklin Sayre
* Brian Zelip


## Objective:
__To provide guidance for collaboratively developing computational biology pipelines through NCBI-style hackathons__
## Our Method:
* Observe groups and projects over time, especially:
  * How objectives and the scope of the project changes over time;
  * The skills, software, processes required to run a successful hackathon/group;
  * How groups interact and communicate.
