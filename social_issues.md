# 1. Team-Based Hackathon

According to the [Team-based Learning Collaborative](http://www.teambasedlearning.org/definition/): 

```
Team-Based Learning is an evidence based collaborative learning teaching strategy designed around units of instruction, known as “modules,” that are taught in a three-step cycle: preparation, in-class readiness assurance testing, and application-focused exercise. A class typically includes one module.
```

We therefore propose to use the Team-based learning (TBL) paradigm to describe and develop a curriculum framework, that educates people in the collaborative processes involved in a hackathon. We have called this framework the "team-based hackathon" (TBH).


## 1.1 Learning objectives
* how to run a hackathon
* reproducibility 

## 1.2 Learning tools

## 1.3 Team assets
* What assets/resources/perspectives do you want distributed among teams? 
* What prior knowledge, interests, learning styles, talents do the Team members bring? Eg:
    * Team-Based Hackathon experience
    * ability to collaborate and share expertise
    
The TBH curriculum focuses on more than an development of WGS data implementation tools.  It addresses the need for researchers to work in teams, utilizing sophisticated levels of interpersonal skills allowing them to collaborate effectively as members of an interdisciplinary team of researchers.  

The context of our TBH curriculum framework is on solving WGS analytical and logistical problems, which arise due to the increasingly large volume of of WGS data. 

## 1.4 Pain points
That is, difficulties to address, overcome, or mitigate.


# 2. Team dynamics during a hackathon
* connecting researcher and computer scientist
    * communicating knowledge
    * coordinating ideas and approaches
* How to get teams motivated and enthusiastic for the work
